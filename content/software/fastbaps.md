Fastbaps is a fast solution to the genetic clustering problem. It rapidly identifies an approximate fit to a Dirichlet process mixture model (DPM) for clustering multilocus genotype data. Our efficient model-based clustering approach clusters datasets 10â€“100 times larger than the existing model-based methods.
