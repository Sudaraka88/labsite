      <description>The Tonkin-Hill Lab develops computational and statistical techniques to analyse the evolution of microbes. Based at the Peter MacCallum Cancer Center and the Peter Doherty Institute for Infection and Immunity in Melbourne Australia, the group works closely with clinical and wet-lab collaborators to improve our understanding of how microbes evolve, transmit between and interact with their hosts.

      <description>Fastbaps is a fast solution to the genetic clustering problem. It rapidly identifies an approximate fit to a Dirichlet process mixture model (DPM) for clustering multilocus genotype data. Our efficient model-based clustering approach clusters datasets 10–100 times larger than the existing model-based methods.</description>

      <description>Pairsnp is used to quickly obtain pairwise SNP distance matrices from multiple sequence alignments. For larger alignments, pairsnp is an order of magnitude faster than approaches based on pairwise comparison of every site.</description>

      <title>Supervised normalisation can bias microbiome analyses</title>

      <description>Update 10/08/2023 Dr Sepich-Poore has raised some important points in an issue posted to GitHub here.
I’d like to start by thanking Dr Sepich-Poore for highlighting these issues and providing constructive feedback. I also wish to emphasize that the analysis in my blog doesn’t definitively determine the presence or absence of a cancer-specific microbial signature in the TCGA data; rather, it emphasises the importance of normalisation in microbiome studies.
The first important point raised by Dr Sepich-Poore, is that the use of Supervised Normalisation in the original TCGA paper did not include cancer type as the biological variable of interest.</description>

      <title>How many gene annotations are there?</title>

      <description>Grace Blackwell recently gave a really interesting talk on her work generating a standardised and curated database of 661,405 bacterial genome assemblies using read data retrieved from the European Nucleotide Archive (ENA).
This dataset is already proving to be very useful. Grace has plans to generate gene annotations for the assemblies but was still deciding on the best approach for doing this in a standardised way across the very diverse dataset.</description>

      <description>Dr Tonkin-Hill’s research at the University of Oslo focuses on the development and application of statistical and computational methods to study the interactions between humans and microbes. Specifically, he is interested in how microbes evolve within and transmit between people and the impacts of pharmaceutical and surgical interventions. He has developed several popular computational tools to infer pathogen population structure, transmission networks and bacterial pangenomes. He has a Masters in Probability and Statistics and completed his PhD in Mathematical Genomics and Medicine at the University of Cambridge and the Wellcome Sanger Institute.</description>
