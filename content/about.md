The Tonkin-Hill Lab develops computational and statistical techniques to analyse the evolution of microbes. Based at the [Peter MacCallum Cancer Center](https://www.petermac.org/) and the [Peter Doherty Institute for Infection and Immunity](https://www.doherty.edu.au/) in Melbourne Australia, the group works closely with clinical and wet-lab collaborators to improve our understanding of how microbes evolve, transmit between and interact with their hosts.
