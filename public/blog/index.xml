      <description>Update 10/08/2023 Dr Sepich-Poore has raised some important points in an issue posted to GitHub here.
I’d like to start by thanking Dr Sepich-Poore for highlighting these issues and providing constructive feedback. I also wish to emphasize that the analysis in my blog doesn’t definitively determine the presence or absence of a cancer-specific microbial signature in the TCGA data; rather, it emphasises the importance of normalisation in microbiome studies.
The first important point raised by Dr Sepich-Poore, is that the use of Supervised Normalisation in the original TCGA paper did not include cancer type as the biological variable of interest.</description>

      <description>Grace Blackwell recently gave a really interesting talk on her work generating a standardised and curated database of 661,405 bacterial genome assemblies using read data retrieved from the European Nucleotide Archive (ENA).
This dataset is already proving to be very useful. Grace has plans to generate gene annotations for the assemblies but was still deciding on the best approach for doing this in a standardised way across the very diverse dataset.</description>
